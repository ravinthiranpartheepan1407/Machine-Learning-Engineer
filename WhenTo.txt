When to use a list?

 - It has order
 - Definite use cases
 - if only few info needed processed
 - Want to have mutable feature
 - Can have duplicates

When to use a dictionary?

 - It is not sorted
 - Random cases
 - If more info need to processed
 - Want to implement a immutable feature
 - Keys are unique; if duplicate exists it will override to the last element

 Good Code:

 - Don't DRY (Do not repeat yourself), copy and paste
 - Predictability
 - Easier to understand
 - Make it reusable
 - Clean : Prettier lines
