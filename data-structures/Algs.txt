# Doubly Linked List: Used to have additional node
# First New node in the block points to it's previous head node
# The last new node in the new block points to the previous head node.

# Singly vs Doubly
    # Singly :
        # Lesser Memory
        # Cannot be iterated in reverse
        # Use it when the logic needs less memory to process (For ex: Searching)
    # Doubly :
        # It can be iterated both in reverse and from front.
        # It is complex to implementation
        # Cost extra ops
        # Requires more memory and storage
        # Good for searching in backwards
