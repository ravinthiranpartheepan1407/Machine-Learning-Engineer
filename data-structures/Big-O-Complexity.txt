# Omega Notation: Only cares about excellent Case
# Theta Notation: Only cares about average case
# Big-O: Only cares about the worst Case

### Solve Problems that's what matters
### Remember: Write code for readability but not for optimizing time and space complexity...
### Balancing Readability and Good Space & Time Complexity is always outstanding
_________________________________________________________

Good Code Means:

- Make it easier to read
- Speed: Good time complexity (Big O)
- Memory: Space complexity (Big O) as well

_________________________________________________________

Program executes based on two things:

### Heap: Where we store the variables
### Stack: Where we keep track of function call; used to optimize less memory

_________________________________________________________

O(n!): Worst
O(2^n): Worst
O(n^2): Worst
_________________________________________________________

O(n log n): Okay
_________________________________________________________

O(n): Good (Iteratives)
_________________________________________________________

O(log n): Excellent
O(1): Excellent (Assignment)
_________________________________________________________

### Rule Book:
_________________________________________________________
Rule 1: Worst Case
Rule 2: Remove Constants
Rule 3: Different term for inputs
Rule 4: Drop non dominants

_________________________________________________________

### O(n): Linear Time
_________________________________________________________
# No. of ops == No.of Elements (For ex: 4 items in list then there's gonna be 4 ops) -> Linear Operation
# All Linear Ops have O(n)
# O(n) -> Big O depends on no.of inputs
_________________________________________________________

### O(1): Constant Time
_________________________________________________________
# O(1) : Process only one item in the list no matter how many items are there in a list.
# O(1): Has excellent Big-O complexity
# No.of elements Process = 1 (Only one) and the ops going to be flat; it cannot concurrenlty run iterative process for the elements
_________________________________________________________

# Nested Loops will have: O(arbitrary_var * aritrary_var = arbitrary_var^2) # Refer nested_mn_complexity.py
# Single iter loop segments will haveL O(arbitrary_var + arbitrary_var) # Refer mn_complexity.py

### What causes space complexity?

- Variables
- Function calls
- Allocations
- Data Structures
