# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
# The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
# Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Breakdown:

# 1. Assign list_1 and list_2
# 2. Iterate through list indexes as list_1[0..n] and list-2[0..2]
# 3. Add the iterated indexes
