- Inferential Statistics is all about probability
    - Probability tells how likely an event occurs or how likely a proposition is true
    - 0 indicates impossible and 1 indicates possible
    - The sum of all probabilities in a set must sum to 1
    -- # Data must have mutually exclusive labels or bins. For ex: if you wanna calculate a probability on a same TV brand then it is possible.
    -- # But if you wanna calculate probability on different electronic device (Xbox, PS2..) brands with TV then it is not possible because the labels or bins must be same.

# Use % when the probaility ranges from 0 to 100
# Don't use % when probability ranges from 0 to 1

- Use probability when an outcome of an event occurance is uncertain.

- Probability vs proposition    
    - Probability (Depends on a question is phrased):
        - Likelihood of an event occurance or a statement is true
        - Can used to compute only a range of events but it cannot continue continous events.
    - Proposition:
        - Fraction of whole

- Conditional Probability:
    - Depends on no.of factors

- Data Types for Probabilities:
    - Interval: Not Possible because it doesn't have a categorical and rank type. If you wanna compute probability then convert it to discrete
    - Ratio: Not Possible because it doesn't have a categorical and rank type. If you wanna compute probability then convert it to discrete
    - Discrete(Range of numbers): Possible
    - Ordinal: Possible
    - Nominal: Possible 

- Interval and Ratio Probability Example:
    - If the height of man is 166.5491616184841511.... cm
    - The height measurement is not suitable for finding the probability range...
    - So it must be converted to discrete type as 166 - 167

- Probability actual computation: ## Before computations always validate data type
    - p[index] = 100 x count_of_event[index] / sumOf(total_no_of_events)
    - For ex: A jar containing: 40 Blue balls, 30 Yellow balls, 20 Ornage balls then the probability would be
    - p[blue] = 100 x 40 / 90 = 44.4%             # 90 - Total balls and 40 - Blue Balls
    - p[yellow] = 100 x 30 / 90 = 33.3%
    - p[orange] = 100 x 20 / 90 = 22.2%           # Sum of all the occurance "SANITY CHECK" is (99.9%): 100% -> 44.4 + 33.3 + 22.2
    - Sanity Check = 44.4 + 33.3 + 22.2 = 99.9%

- Probability and Odds (Both are closely related to each other):
    - Odds (Nothing but a Ratio) For ex: The odds are 6:1 against
    - Formula: n:m = n/m
    - Actual Formula: r = (1-p) / p         ## where (1-p) event not occuring and p is event occuring..     # r = (1-p) / p  => 1/1+n/m

    For ex: Start with the expression p = (1 - 4/52) / (4/52).
    -   Simplify the numerator:
    -   p = (48/52) / (4/52).

    -   Divide both the numerator and denominator by 4/52:
    -   p = (48/52) * (52/4).

    -   Simplify the expression:
    -   p = 12/1.

- Probability Mass and Density:
    - Mass: Describe probabilities for a set of exclusive discrete events
    - MDensity: Describe probabilities for a set of exclusive dcontinous events

- Probability Function: f(x) = p(X = x) # Function defines the probability of x in the set X.
    - f(x(base[i])) = p(X = x) # Value of particular element of func is equal to the probability of that event.
    - Such that (st.) p(x = x[index]) >= 0 (Non Negative only allowed)
    - st. p(X != x[index]) = 0 (One category will processed at a time and the rest will be 0)
    - sumOf(p(X = x[index])) = 1 (Probability of all elements should equal to 1)

- Probability Mass Functions (Exclusively discrete events):
    - Probabilities visualization should be in bar plot or histogram (Discrete events should be seperated and don't draw lines inbetween events)

- Probability Density Function (Exclusively continous events):
    - To calculate the in between event (X) value of A and B is: p(a <= x <= b) = calculus high(b) low(a): f(X) dx

- CDF (Cummulative Distributive Function or F-Distribution -> np.linpsace, stats.lognorm.pdf and cdf, np.Cumsum):
    - PDF(T-Distrbution -> Used to find the larger group numbers from the smaller group numbers): Increase and then Decrease
            - PDF always sum upto 1.
    - CDF(Cummulative Sum of Probablity Distribution or F-Distribution -> Used to compares different groups to check if they are different from each other: c(x[index] = p(X <= x[index]))): Only Increase
            - CDF Doesn't sum upto 1 hence it's sum will be larger than 1.
            <---> CDF Starts at 0 and Increase more than 1. ## Important Formula: c(x[index] = summation(p(x[index])))
            - Y-axis values at x-value is the sum of probabilities to the left of x-value. c(x[index] = integral: Low=-infinity High=index p(x (base(t) dt)))

- Use the t-distribution (PDF) when you have a small group of numbers and want to make guesses about the larger group they represent.
- Use the F-distribution (CDF) when you have three or more groups and want to compare them to see if they are really different from each other.
