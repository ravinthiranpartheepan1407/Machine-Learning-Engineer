# Z-Transform relies on mean as central tendency and std as dispersion of data (Not median)

# Many Statistical Methods are linear or assume it's Gaussian

# Non extreme data values are outliers due to non linear scaling

## Non Linear Trasnformation Goal is to make linear methods valid or make the data distribution in a gaussian distrbution

# Common Non-Linear Data Transformation: If there is a right skew distribution or negative distrbution the take Logarithm or Square root

    # Rank Transform: value = {5.1, 2, 0, 39.57} -> rank(value) = {3,2,1,4}
    # Logarithm
    # Sqaure root
    # Fisher-Z: Brings a uniform distribution and transforms into gaussian distribution

# Non linear transormation alter spacing between data points as a function of data value

# Most statistical methods are linear and the non linear transformation results should be interpreted only from transformed data not from the originla data.
