# IQR (Inter Quartile Range): Occur in box plots
# Median: Splits the dataset (some % below the median and some % above the median)
# Q1: Split_1 is Quartile 1 (Data Minimum to 1st split)
# Q2: Split 2 is Quartile 2 (Median Split)
# Q3: Split 3 is Quartile 3 (Split 3 to Data Max)

# Q1(Split1: Start [Note: Not from Data Min]) - Q2 - Q3(Split3: End [Note: Only the Q3 starting point not upto Data Max])

# For ex: 0(Data Min) - 25(Quartile 1) <-> 50(Median: Quartile 2) <-> 75(Quartile 3) - 100(data Max)
# Inter-Quartile Range: 25(Quartile 1) <-> 50(Median: Quartile 2) <-> 75(Quartile 3)

## Data with lower Interquartile range (IQR) is said to have higher data
