Descriptive Statistics:
    - Not used to realted your particular data with other group or dataset
    - Used for characterize the a particular data feature
    - Can apply: Mean, Median, mode, variance, skew, Kurtosis, Distribution Shape, Spectrum(Frequency, Time Series)

Inferential Statistics:
    - Used for relating a data feature with other groups or dataset
    - Can apply: T/F/Chi-Square, Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Interval, P-Value

Accuracy:
    - Used to find the relationship between the measurement and real world value
    - If the measured temp is 25-30c today and the real world temp is also between 25-30c then it has higher Accuracy
    - If the measured temp is 30-35c but the real worl temp is 20-25 then it is a bias (Low acccuracy)

Precision:
    - Certainity of a measurement
    - For ex: If the data measurement is closer to each other or similar to each other then it has higher precision 
    - Inversely related to variance.
    - Modern cameras (Higher Precision) and Dish Taste at different hotel (Low precision because tastes differs in diff hotels)

Resolution:
    - If there are enormous amount of data then there will be good resolution but noisy too
    - If there are low amount of data then it have Low resolution

Some examples:
    - If Data Resolution is HIGH and Data closer to each other but different from real word measurement: H(P, R) and L(A)
    - If Data Resolution is LOW and Data closer to each other with closer to real word measurement: L(R) and H(P, A)


Data Distribution (USed to provide insights into nature):
    - Distribution: Number of sample and Number of Frequency
    - Gaussian Distribution: Bell Shaped (Ranges from - to +)
    - T Distribution: Bell Shaped (Smoothened, Ranges from - to +)
    - F Distribution: Ranges only from +
    - Chi-Sqaure (Pronounced as kai) Ranges only from +
    - If there is only one peek then it is a unimodal distribution
    - If there are multiple peek then it is a multimodal distribution

    - Peak start and Peak end space defines the amount of data residing in between

    - Rieman Sum used for computing the area under the curve
    - Rieman_Compute = height of each points * width of x-axis and the do SUM(Rieman_Compute)

PDF: Use when you want to find the likelihood of an element of a continous range of variable
CDF: Use when you want to find the likelihood of an element upto a certain range of variable.

Bell_Shaped: Only occurs when the scores are normal distributed (mean == median and St.Deviation gives idea on how to spread the data around the mean)
Linear Shaped (Low-to-High): Only occurs when the scores are equal
Skewed Distribution: Only occurs when the scores are not symmmetrical distributed such as one end i higher than other end.
Right or Left skewed ch-squared distribution: Only occurs when the scores has bias or any limit.

Want to calculate probability? Then always use: elements[index] / total elements

Analytical Gaussian Distribution: Describe the data from theoretical formula
Emperical Normal Distribution: Describe the data from real data not from the formula (Gives more clarity on requirements than in Gaussian)
