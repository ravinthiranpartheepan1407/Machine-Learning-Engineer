# A Table is just a collection of records

# CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO VALUES, SELECT FROM, AS,.. - Keyword
# Identifiers - Name we are going to assign for the table

# INSERT Params should match VALUES params

# In Select Query: * get all the data.
    - To rename an imaginary column use "AS" Keyword
    - We can also perform math ops and comparitive check in Select
