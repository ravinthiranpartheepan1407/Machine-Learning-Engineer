# Subset: A set of points satisfies some condition
# Subset: Doesn't include origin but subspace does.
# Subset: can have boundries.
# Subset: Doesn't have to be closed

# For ex:
    # x^2 + y^2 = 1 (This is a subset) Not a subspace because it doesn't include zero also the condition must be = 1 which is > 0
    # y = 4x (This is a subspace) because it includes origin and x ca be scaled from -infinity to 0 to +infinity
    # x > 0 (This is a subset) Not a subspace because it doesn't include zero
    # x >= 0 (This is a subspace) because it includes origin
    # y = 4x+1 (this is a subset) because it doesn't met the origin -> I.e, y = 4(0) + 1 = 1
