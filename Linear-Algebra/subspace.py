# Subspace is to check scalar vector ∈ R (Real Numbers) AKA used to checking [linear combinations: scalar mul and add] of vectors
## A vector subspace must contain: Closed under scalar mul and add; Contain zero vector (All subspaces must intersect the origin)

# This symbol (∀) denotes "For any"

# For ex: α.v + beta.w ∈ R => where,
#                       α = 6, v = horizontal_vec[2,3], 
#                       beta = 2, w = horizontal_vec[0,4]
#                       R = horizontal_vec[12,26]

### Should be a member α.v + beta.w ∈ horizontal_vec[12,26]

# Solution: α.v + beta.w = 6 . horizontal_vec[2,3] + 2 . horizontal_vec[0,4] => horizontal_vec[12,18] + horizontal_vec[0,8]
#           α.v + beta.w = horizontal_vec[12,26]   # Result
#           α.v + beta.w ∈ R                       # Condition met (It is a member)

### Example Statements: 
    #  ∀ v,w ∈ R: This statement explains For any vectors v, w that is a member of R (Real Number)
    ## ∀ αv+βw ∈ R: This statement explains For any scalar vectors αv, βw it's linear combination should be a memeber of real numbers

#### Note:
#    - If the vectors cannot math the member even with scaled with scalar mul then it will have [ multi dimensional planes (AKA): HYPERPLANE ]
#    - If the vectors can match the members with scalar mul then it will have single dimensional plane
