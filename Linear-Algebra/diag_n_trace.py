# Digonalization: Takes Input as Matrix and returns Output as Vector
# Diagonalization defined by: Square and Rectangular matrix

# Trace (only defined for Square matrix): it's just sumOf all the diagonal elements.

# Diagonal: v[subscript(i)] = A[subscript(i, i)]
# Trace:    tr(A) = sumOf(A[subscript(i, i)])

# Note: np.trace(), np.diag()

# Solve: tr(A) + tr(B) = tr(A+B)
# Solve: tr(α * A) = α * tr(A)
