# Dimensions are nothing but element present in a vectors.
# For ex: [
#           1 -4i
#           2i
#           4
#           7
#         ]

# The above vectors is a 4D so it will 4 axis on the cartesian axis.
# The shape is (4,1): 4 rows and 1 Column

# Field: It's just a set of numbers on which add, sub, mul, and div are valid ops.
# Field can represented as R (Real Numbers), C (Complex Numbers), Z (Integers: Counting members)
# Where R,C,Z called as superscript
