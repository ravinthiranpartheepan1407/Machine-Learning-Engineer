# Matrix denoted by Capital Letter "A"
# Diagonal: Start from 1st Index and goes diagonally respective from 1st index.

# Matrix shape calcuated: Rows [M] x Columns [N]
    # Subscripts are nothing but base value

# How to calc Dimesnionality:
    # For vectors = no.of elements
    # For Matrix = M x N

## Square Matrix: Same number of rows and columns [M x M]

## Rectangular Matrix:
#   - (A sqaure is just a special case of Rect but in LinAlg to reduce ambiguity we call it as Rectangle): 
#   - [M x N] or [M != N]

## Symmetric Matrix (only a square matrix can be symmetric):               
#   - Cut off diagonal because it's mirror itself and the remaining elements have it's respective copies.

## Skew-Symmetric:                                                         
#   - Similar to Symmetric but it will flip the signs such as (+ve -> -ve / -ve to +ve) for all the elements including the diagonal

## Identity Matrix (Denoted as: "I" with subscript[("M")] => M x M) [Always a square and symmetric matrix]: 
#   - The diagonal will have 1's or Same values on the diagonal and all the remaining elements will have 0's

## Zero Matrix:
#   - All the elements will be 0
#   - Denoted by 0

## Diagonal Matrix (Can also have squared or rectangle diagonal matrix):
#   - It will have non-zeros on the diagonal
#   - But some elements can have zeros on the diagonal but not entirely otherwise it's a Zero Matrix
#   - Zeros on the all remaining elements
#   - Identity Diagonal Matrix canbe written as: "αI" => DiagonalVal . I
#       - For ex: If all the diagonal values are 3 then it will be αI = 3I

## Upper Triangular:
#   - All the elements below the diagonal must be zero

## Lower Triangular:
#   - All the elements above the diagonal must be zero

## Type (or) Augmented (or) Concatenated Matrix (Denoted as: || or |_|):
#   - Should have same no.of rows but doesn't need to have same no.of columns
#   - A concat B = [ A | B]
#   - The matrix A will be joined with matrix B with a vertical split between two matrices
